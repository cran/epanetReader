\description{
Read an Epanet .inp file into R
}
\details{
This function reads a text file in Epanet's .inp format
and returns an S3 object with entries for
sections of the .inp file.  Sections of the .inp file that are implemented
appear in the Value section.

ID fields are stored as characters not factors or integers.

Sections that are absent from the .inp file are NULL in the list.

Columns of data.frames use the headings exported by
the Epanet GUI.

The [OPTIONS] section in the .inp file is used to update
         a list of Epanet's default options. In this way if an option such as
         units is not specified by the .inp file, the units that would be used by
         default are provided.

In the [PATTERNS] and [CURVES] sections, integers used as names of list elements are backquoted
         according to the default behavior in R.  So if the .inp file has a pattern "1"
         this pattern will appear as element `1` in the list that is returned. A warning is issued in this case.
